# BlockRunnerBattle

Block runner was created as part of an assignment, where the main focus was to create a game that is considerate of fundamental game design principles.
The brief was to create a game that carefully considered all aspects of the games design, from Character Movement and Level Design to the Core Game Dynamic and Formal Framework. 
Our game was designed using "Fullertons Fundamental Elements" and all aspects were created using her theory. We also considered the theories of Salen and Zimmerman, considering the constitutive, operation and implicit rules surrounding the game. 

The outcome of the assignment was to have a game where all decisions made in the design can be carefully explained using the relative theories.
